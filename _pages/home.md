Welcome to the Intelligent Systems and Machine learning Algorithms Research and Technology (iSMART) lab, led by [Prof. Narges Armanfard](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/narges-armanfard). We are a dynamic research labrotary within the Intelligent Systems Research Group at [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/), McGill University. Our aim is to develop novel algorithms in machine learning and related areas in computer vision, reinforcement learning, subspace learning for data clustering and classification, and anomaly detection.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Human Activity Recognition:** We aim at using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address the human activity recognition problem. It is a popular research field in computer vision and plays an important role in many real-world intelligent systems. DRL methods are specifically used when ground-truth is not available, or if the designed objective function is non-differentiable. Therefore, we can use it for different tasks such as spatial and temporal attention finding in videos to improve human activity recognition performance. In this project, we also explore multitask learning (MTL) that have recently gained a lot of popularity as a learning paradigm. It can lead to improved per-task performance while also using fewer per-task model parameters compared to single task learning. Our research involves developing novel MTL algorithms that can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various computer vision tasks. Some of the main tasks we will be focusing on are pose estimation and activity recognition.

**Representation Learning:** Deep neural networks are capable of learning the underlying representation of data. Representation Learning is a fundamental problem in many data-driven application domains. A good representation can improve the performance of downstream tasks, such as clustering and anomaly detection. Our goal is to develop unimodal and multi-modal self-supervised and unsupervised representation learning algorithm which are useful for clustering and anomaly detection.

**Machine Learning in Healthcare:** Recent advances in Machine Learning have enabled the design of effective healthcare diagnosis and monitoring devices. We are currently working on implementing state-of-the art Machine Learning algorithms for assisting epileptic patients by improving the accuracy of epileptogenic zone detection prior to the removal surgery. Another stream of this project is designing smart home devices for unobtrusive physiological monitoring.

**Industrial Automation:**  Industrial automation is the use of data-driven control systems, whether computers, process controllers or robots, to operate industrial processes or machinery in a way that reduces the need for human action. We are working on developing Machine Learning algorithms in order to yield a more robust and accurate performance and improve the productivity.
