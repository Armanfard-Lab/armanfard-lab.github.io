Welcome to Intelligent Systems and Machine learning Algorithms Reseach and Technology (iSMART) lab. We are a dynamic research labrotary within the Intelligent Systems Research Group at [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/), McGill University. Our aim is to develop novel algorithms in machine learning and related areas in computer vision, reinforcement learning, subspace learning for data clustering and classification, and anomaly detection.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Time-Series Anomaly Detection**  In this project, we aim to develop a self-supervised representation learning framework for time-series data. Our work will be based on state-of-the-art self-supervised algorithms, such as contrastive learning, and we will try to make it suitable for time-series data by incorporating architectures such as temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and ideas such as self-attention. 

**Active Learning**

**Epileptic Zone Detection**

**Deep Anomaly Detection**


**Deep Clustering**

**Action Recognition**
