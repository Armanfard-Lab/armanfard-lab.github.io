Welcome to the Intelligent Systems and Machine learning Algorithms Research and Technology (iSMART) lab, led by [Prof. Narges Armanfard](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/narges-armanfard). We are a dynamic research labrotary within the Intelligent Systems Research Group at [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/), McGill University. Our aim is to develop novel algorithms in machine learning and related areas in computer vision, reinforcement learning, subspace learning for data clustering and classification, and anomaly detection.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Human Activity Recognition:**It is a popular research field in computer vision and plays an important role in many real-world intelligent systems. We aim at using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address the human activity recognition problem. DRL methods are specifically used when ground-truth is not available, or if the designed objective function is non-differentiable. Therefore, we can use it for different tasks such as spatial and temporal attention finding in videos to improve human activity recognition performance.

**Multitask Learning with Attention:** Multitask learning (MTL) has recently gained a lot of popularity as a learning paradigm that can lead to improved per-task performance while also using fewer per-task model parameters compared to single task learning. Our research involves developing novel MTL algorithms that can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various computer vision tasks. Some of the main tasks we will be focusing on are pose estimation and activity recognition.

**Epileptogenic Zone Detection:** In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that automatically analyzes the background information collected iEEG to determine whether the corresponding intracerebral channels are located in the brain tissue belonging to the epileptogenic zone, without accessing seizure on set zone (SOZ). We will tackle the EZ identification problem by using advanced representation learning models. Our goal is to develop an algorithm which can aid epileptologists in identifying brain areas to be resected during epilepsy surgery.

**Deep Anomaly Detection:** Anomaly Detection is the task of identifying rare items, events or observations which deviate significantly from the majority of the data. In recent years, researchers have turned their attention to developing deep learning based anomaly detection models that yielded an unprecedented success. In this project, our goal is to develop novel anomaly detection algorithms using state-of-the-art deep models, such as contrastive learning.


**Deep Clustering:** Clustering is a fundamental problem in many data-driven application domains, and clustering performance is heavily influenced by data representation quality. we intend to develop a novel deep clustering framework that could improve data representation of other existing deep clustering methods.
