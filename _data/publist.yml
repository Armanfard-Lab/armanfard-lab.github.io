- title: "Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection: A Survey and Outlook"
  image: ssl (1).png
  description: Recently, the emergence of self-supervised learning has sparked the development of new anomaly detection algorithms that surpassed state-of-the-art accuracy by a significant margin. This paper aims to review the current approaches in self-supervised anomaly detection. We present technical details of the common approaches and discuss their strengths and drawbacks. We also compare the performance of these models against each other and other state-of-the-art anomaly detection models. Finally, we discuss a variety of new directions for improving the existing algorithms.

- title: "Multistep networks for roll force prediction in hot strip rolling mill"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: In this paper, we propose a machine learning based framework to establish a model that accurately predicts roll forces at each mill stands of the hot strip rolling mill. In contrast to the traditional models, the proposed expert system considers an individual model for each rolling stand and employs rolling history when predicting roll forces. The proposed model includes both steel chemistry and physical process parameters for its predictions.

- title: "Deep Clustering with Self-supervision using Pairwise Data Similarities"
  image: final_model-1.png
  description: In this paper we propose a novel deep clustering framework with self-supervision using pairwise data similarities (DCSS). The proposed method consists of two successive phases. In the first phase we propose to form hypersphere-like groups of similar data points, i.e. one hypersphere per cluster, employing an autoencoder which is trained using cluster-specific losses.

- title: "Self-Supervised Acoustic Anomaly Detection Via Contrastive Learning"
  image: ICASSP.jpg
  description: For the first time, we propose a contrastive learning-based framework that is suitable for acoustic anomaly detection. Since most existing contrastive learning approaches are targeted toward images, the effect of other data transformations on the performance of the algorithm is unknown. Our framework learns a representation from unlabeled data by applying audio-specific data augmentations.

- title: "DASVDD: Deep Autoencoding Support Vector Data Descriptor for Anomaly Detection"
  image: DASVDD.png
  description: In this paper, we propose a method, DASVDD, that jointly learns the parameters of an autoencoder while minimizing the volume of an enclosing hyper-sphere on its latent representation. We propose a customized anomaly score which is a combination of autoencoder's reconstruction error and distance of the lower-dimensional representation of a sample from the center of the enclosing hyper-sphere.
