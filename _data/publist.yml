- title: "Direct evidence for Cooper pairing without a spectral gap in a disordered superconductor above Tc"
  image: Pairs3.png
  description: We use our atomic-scale scanning tunneling noise setup on a disordered superconductor, and discover a state above TC that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap, but carries charge via paired electrons.

- title: "Imaging moiré deformation and dynamics in twisted bilayer graphene"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: Why is there so much variation in TBG devices? And are open devices more disordered than encapsulated ones? We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moiré lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.

- title: "Deep Clustering with Self-supervision using Pairwise Data Similarities"
  image: final_model-1.png
  description: In this paper we propose a novel deep clustering framework with self-supervision using pairwise data similarities (DCSS). The proposed method consists of two successive phases. In the first phase we propose to form hypersphere-like groups of similar data points, i.e. one hypersphere per cluster, employing an autoencoder which is trained using cluster-specific losses.

- title: "Self-Supervised Acoustic Anomaly Detection Via Contrastive Learning"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: For the first time, we propose a contrastive learning-based framework that is suitable for acoustic anomaly detection. Since most existing contrastive learning approaches are targeted toward images, the effect of other data transformations on the performance of the algorithm is unknown. Our framework learns a representation from unlabeled data by applying audio-specific data augmentations.

  description: We propose a deep clustering technique, called IDECF, whereby the true cluster assignments are estimated using an individual deep fully connected network (FCM-Net) which takes its input from the latent space of an autoencoder.

  description: We propose to formulate the joint selection problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where we employ deep reinforcement learning to find the most informative joints per frame. The proposed joint selection method is a general framework that can be employed to improve the existing human activity classification methods.

- title: "DASVDD: Deep Autoencoding Support Vector Data Descriptor for Anomaly Detection"
  image: TBG_ARPES.png
  description: In this paper, we propose a method, DASVDD, that jointly learns the parameters of an autoencoder while minimizing the volume of an enclosing hyper-sphere on its latent representation. We propose a customized anomaly score which is a combination of autoencoder's reconstruction error and distance of the lower-dimensional representation of a sample from the center of the enclosing hyper-sphere.
